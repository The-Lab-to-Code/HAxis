Welcome to HAxis, the simple, yet best programming language made out of Haxe!
HAxis is a basic programing language / REPL created by me. HAxis can do many things, including:
Printing text,
accessing files,
and more!
If you would like to give HAxis a feature, please email me at black.hole.of.nothingness@gmail.com

Here is the steps on how to run HAxis.

1. The VSCode way.
Requirements: Haxe Toolkit for VSCode, VSCode (latest model)
First, you make a folder in your files section. Name it anything. Then, download this ZIP file, extract the contents, and put the .hx and the .hxml in the folder. Next, go to VSCode, and insert the folder in. You should see the programming contents appearing. Save both files, the .hx and the .hxml. (NOTE: The .hx will NOT work without the .hxml)
After saving both of the files, in the terminal, type:

Haxe build.hxml

After you type that, the program will work.

2. The online compiler way.
View the contents of the .hx file, and copy it. Then go to a Haxe online compiler that supports interactive input, preferrably JDoodle, TutorialsPoint, or Replit. Then, hit run, and HAxis will run.

Current HAxis version: [3.25]

DO NOT EDIT, CHANGE, OR CLAIM HAxis AS YOUR OWN.
